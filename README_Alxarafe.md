# alxarafe

Alxarafe is a refactoring of the ERP-CRM Dolibarr.

Alxarafe is installed on Dolibarr with the idea of replacing it completely, using an MVC pattern, object-oriented programming, and a more up-to-date version of PHP.

The objective would be to find an alternative to migrate the Dolibarr facilities to more modern software, with the idea of being able to replace it completely without ceasing to use what already exists.
