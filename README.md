# alxarafe

Alxarafe, it reads Aljarafe, is a free software project, which aims to become a simple but powerful development
environment, designed with PHP 7.4 and composer, following an MVC design pattern.

The main objective is to keep a learning curve, as short as possible, with a simple, flexible and robust development (
almost nothing!).

Alxarafe will be designed to be an independent project, but it may overlap with Dolibarr to try to replace it in the
future.

The code developed here can be used by the Dolibarr community to improve its product.
